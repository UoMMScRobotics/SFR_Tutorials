Conclusion
===========

**Topics in this Tutorial**
* Writing URDF files using XML format .urdf files
* Using URDF files to describe the physical properties of a robot
* Describing rigid body poses using `links <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link>`_ (coordinate frames) and `joints <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint>`_ (transformations)
* Adding visual information through use of `links <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link>`_
* Additional information is available for simulations, such as Collisional and Inertial properties
* All these properties can be viewed in RVIZ

A topic which was not covered here was the use of `**xacro** <https://github.com/ros/xacro/wiki>`_.  This functionality enables a urdf to have variables and include other files, this generally makes them easier to edit and easier to read.
