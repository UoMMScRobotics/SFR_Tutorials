Conclusion
=============

**Topics in this Tutorial**

* How sensors such as lidar can be used to generate occupancy grids 
* Using these sensors and an existing map, it is possible to localise a robot in a global frame
* Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) allows for the robot to localise _and_ make a map at the same time


Now the robot knows where it is in the world (and also where things are which it might bump into), it is now possible to use semi-autonomous navigation to have the robot move on our behalf.  Finally moving from teleoperation to true autonomy!
